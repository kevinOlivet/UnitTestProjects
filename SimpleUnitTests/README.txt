#SimpleUnitTests

This is a simple project with a few unit tests.
One tests if a number returns even using XCTAssertTrue and XCTAssertFalse

Another tests the sum of even valued numbers in a Fibonacci Sequence using XCTAssertEqual with a message of the expected result.

The third tests the percent that should be returned for game coins in relation to game price.

The fourth tests if the outlets in the storyboard have been connected correctly and aren't  nil.

The fifth tests if the ferrari.miles are equal to the correct number.

There is a simple Person model with name and hairColor attributes.
A separate PersonTests file tests the initializers.

There is also a simple Car model with miles, type and transmissionMode attributes.
A separate CarTests file tests if ferrari.miles > jeep.miles
