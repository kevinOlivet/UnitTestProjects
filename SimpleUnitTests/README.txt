#SimpleUnitTests

This is a simple project with a few unit tests.
One tests if a number returns even using XCTAssertTrue and XCTAssertFalse

Another tests the sum of even valued numbers in a Fibonacci Sequence using XCTAssertEqual with a message of the expected result.

The third tests the percent that should be returned for game coins in relation to game price.

There is a simple Person model with name and hairColor attributes.
A separate PersonTests file tests the initializers.
